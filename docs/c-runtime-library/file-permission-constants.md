# File Permission Constants

## Syntax

```
#include <sys/stat.h>
```

## Remarks

One of these constants is required when `_O_CREAT` (`_open`, `_sopen`) is specified.

The `pmode` argument specifies the file's permission settings as follows.

|Constant|Meaning|
|--------------|-------------|
|`_S_IREAD`|Reading permitted|
|`_S_IWRITE`|Writing permitted|
|`_S_IREAD | _S_IWRITE`|Reading and writing permitted|

When used as the `pmode` argument for `_umask`, the manifest constant sets the permission setting, as follows.

|Constant|Meaning|
|--------------|-------------|
|`_S_IREAD`|Writing not permitted (file is read-only)|
|`_S_IWRITE`|Reading not permitted (file is write-only)|
|`_S_IREAD | _S_IWRITE`|Neither reading nor writing permitted|
